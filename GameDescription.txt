Game description:
Genre: SciFi-Fantasy Free for All FPS

Players spawn inside a forest arena (circular?), inside the forest are various resources (stone, metals, wood, magic stuff) which can be collected by the playersand stored in their inventory.
On the outskirts of the forest is a shop area where players can trade resources for upgrades (weapons, armor, skills, etc). Additionally the shop contains an expensive item "key".
In the center of the forest is a gated area which requires the key to open. The first player to get inside the gate wins the round.

There are so far 4 class ideas:
Mage: Flimsy but can aquire a variety of magic skills.
High damage, traps, mobility

Ranger: Stealthy, fights from afar

Warrior: Close range, hard to kill

Engineer: Average bulkiness, builds AI-controlled robots
-> resource collection robots
-> static defense turrets
-> patrolling combat drones
-> scouting drones
